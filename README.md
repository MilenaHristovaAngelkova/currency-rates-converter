# Basic Currency Rates App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a basic app that supplies conversion rates information, based on the selected currency.
Rates are obtained from the https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api service using the latest rates for the selected currency rounded up to 1 digit after the decimal point. 
Rates from the selected currency are used directly, whereas rates to the selected currency are calculated by 1 / the respective rate for the other currency (i. e., if the USD to CAD rate is 1 USD for 1.3 CAD, the USD-CAD rate is 1.3 and the CAD-USD rate is 1/1.3 = 0.8).
Localstorage is used to hold the previously viewed data for the respective currency if the user accesses the app again from the same browser during the same day.

You can see the app [here](https://milenahristovaangelkova.github.io/currency-rates-converter/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
